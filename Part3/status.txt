Part 3: Status Report

*********************************************************************************************
o In this file, state explicitly if your design fully works or not, and explain how you
tested it.
o If the design has any known problems, clearly document them. (You do not need
to explain prior problems that are now solved. I just want to see details of any
remaining bugs you are aware of in the submitted design.)
o Similarly, if you have any uncorrected synthesizability problems, document them
here.
o For example, if it fails simulation or synthesis under certain sets of parameters or
situations, explain them to the best of your ability.
o If your design is perfect, your status report should be very short. Simply state how
you tested it, and that you do not observe any problems with your system.

The design for inputs memory module worked as intended.

The final code did not have result in any errors when tested with the testbench.

We also used different sets of parameters to ensure robustness: 
./simParams3 8 5 4 3 0.6 1
./simParams3 24 9 8 4 0.7 1
./simParams3 10 15 13 7 0.75 1
